# Personal_Website_Jeff
This is a personal website created for the purpose of showing my interests and professional background

the website is built using basic html symantic's and basic CSS styling with seperate style sheets for each "page" in the website.
In addition to css and HTML there is basic javascript hidden in tbe backend! 

All troubleshooting for this website during the development was done using the Live server plugin in VS Code, as this website is currently not hosted on a cloud VM (IE Azure) it should be ran locally until it is ready to be hosted.
